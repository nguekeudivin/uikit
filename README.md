# UIKit

**UIKit** is a modern, flexible dashboard UI kit built to help developers and product teams quickly launch new ideas. I created this project to accelerate my own capacity to build and ship products quickly ‚Äî and decided to make it public to share with the community.

**UIKit** includes a rich collection of components and templates for a variety of use cases:

- **Analytics** dashboards
- **E-commerce** storefronts
- **Banking** and finance
- **Booking** and reservations
- **File Management** systems
- **E-learning** platforms
- **User Management** flows
- **Invoice** and billing systems
- **Blogs** and content sites
- **Job Marketplaces**
- **Chat** applications
- **Kanban** boards
- ... and much more!

Got it! Here's a more detailed section on how to use the project, weaving in the `package.json` scripts:

---

### üöÄ Getting Started

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install the dependencies**
Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the development server**
To start the project in development mode (with hot reload):

```bash
npm run dev
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the production server**
Once built, you can start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

---

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the mock database server**
UIKit includes a small mock database for local development, served with `json-server`. Start it with:

```bash
npm run db
```

This will spin up a fake API server at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

---

### üìù Example Workflow

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start mock API
npm run db

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

You‚Äôll have the UI kit running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the mock API at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
